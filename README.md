# Real-Time Embedded Systems Project

## Overview
A multifunction embedded system designed for the STM32F407 microcontroller, developed using Keil µVision. This project demonstrates task scheduling, multithreading, and real-time behavior using the CMSIS-RTOS RTX framework.

## Installation
1. Ensure Keil MicroVision is installed
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/George-Craft/real-time-embedded-systems-project.git
3. Navigate to the project directory and open `Assignment.uvprojx` in **Keil µVision**.
4. Ensure the **correct STM32F4 toolchain** is installed.
5. Build the project (`Project → Build Target`).
6. Load it to your board or simulate it using Keil’s built-in debugger.

## Results
Results can be seen in the project report in the results folder.
